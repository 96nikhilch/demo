                <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus 12. It is highly contagious and spreads quickly. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and fatigue 12. The disease can be severe and lead to hospitalization or death, especially in older adults and people with underlying medical conditions 12.

                    To protect yourself and others from COVID-19, it is important to follow these guidelines 12:
                    
                    Wear a mask in public settings and around people who donâ€™t live in your household.
                    Stay at least 6 feet away from others who donâ€™t live in your household.
                    Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated spaces.
                    Wash your hands often with soap and water. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water arenâ€™t available.
                    Get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible.
                    India has a dedicated portal called CoWIN for COVID-19 vaccination registration and scheduling 3. You can book an appointment on Co-WIN or walk into any vaccination center to get vaccinated 3. The website also provides information on the different types of vaccines available, vaccination centers near you, and how to download your vaccination certificate 3.
                    
                    Stay safe and healthy! ðŸ˜Š</p>

                    </h1>

                     <p>
                 The history of coronaviruses is an account of the discovery of the diseases caused by coronaviruses and the diseases they cause. It starts with the first report of a new type of upper-respiratory tract disease among chickens in North Dakota, U.S., in 1931. <br>The causative agent was identified as a virus in 1933. By 1936, the disease and the virus were recognised as unique from other viral disease. They became known as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV),<br> but later officially renamed as Avian coronavirus.
                 A new brain disease of mice (murine encephalomyelitis) was discovered in 1947 at Harvard Medical School in Boston. The virus causing the disease was called JHM (after Harvard pathologist John Howard Mueller). Three years later a new mouse hepatitis was reported <br> from the National Institute for Medical Research in London. The causative virus was identified as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV),[1][2] later renamed Murine coronavirus.
                    
                In 1961, a virus was obtained from a school boy in Epsom, England, who was suffering from common cold. The sample designated B814 was confirmed as novel virus in 1965. New common cold viruses (assigned 229E) collected from medical students at the University of Chicago were also reported in 1966. Structural analyses of IBV,<br> MHV, B814 and 229E using transmission electron microscopy revealed that they all belong to the same group of viruses. Making a crucial comparison in 1967, June Almeida and David Tyrrell invented the collective name coronavirus, as all those viruses were characterised by solar corona-like projections (called spikes) on their surfaces.[3]
                    
                Other coronaviruses have been discovered from pigs, dogs, cats, rodents, cows, horses, camels, Beluga whales, birds and bats. As of 2022, 52 species are described. Bats are found to be the richest source of different species of coronaviruses.<br> All coronaviruses originated from a common ancestor about 293 million years ago. Zoonotic species such as Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a variant of SARS-CoV, emerged during the past two decades and caused the first pandemics of the 21st century.

                Symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period. You can still spread COVID-19 before you have symptoms. This is called presymptomatic transmission. Common symptoms can include:

Fever.
Cough.
Tiredness.
Early symptoms of COVID-19 may include a loss of taste or smell.

 <center> <h1> Other symptoms may include:</h1> </center>

                The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a COVID-19 vaccine for everyone age 6 months and older. 
                The COVID-19 vaccine can lower the risk of death or serious illness caused by COVID-19. 
                It lowers your risk and lowers the risk that you may spread it to people around you.
                
                Getting a COVID-19 vaccine also is important because
                 the flu and COVID-19 may be spreading at the same time and cause similar symptoms. 
                 Getting a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine is the best way to protect against both.
                
                The COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are:
                
                2023-2024 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine is available for people age 6 months and older.
                
                Among people with a typical immune system:
                
                Children age 6 months up to age 4 years are up to date after
                 three doses of a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
                People age 5 and older are up to date after one Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
                For people who have not had a 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination, the CDC recommends getting 
                an additional shot of that updated vaccine.
                2023-2024 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine is available for people age 6 months and older.
                
                Among people with a typical immune system:
                
             Children age 6 months up to age 4 are up to date if they've had two doses of a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.
             People age 5 and older are up to date after one Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.
             For people who have not had a 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination,
             the CDC recommends getting an additional shot of that updated vaccine.
             2023-2024 Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine is available for people age 12 years and older.

             Your health care team may suggest added doses of COVID-19 vaccine if you have a moderately or severely weakened immune system.
                
             Vaccination and other actions   
             <center> <h1> You can take many steps to lower your risk of infection from the COVID-19 virus and lower the risk of spreading it to others. The World Health Organization (WHO) and CDC recommend following these precautions:
             </h1> </center>
             <ul>
  
             <li>Get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.</li>
             <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick or has symptoms.</li>
             <li>Keep distance between yourself and others when you're in indoor public spaces. This is especially important if you have a higher risk of serious illness. Keep in mind some people may have COVID-19 and spread it to others, even if they don't have symptoms or don't know they have COVID-19.</li>
             <li>Avoid crowds and indoor places that have poor airflow, also called ventilation.</li>
